# [Ivory][ivory]

Ivory is an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) which aims to provide
a systems-level programming language that removes some common pitfalls of
programming in C, without sacrificing expressivity.

This repository includes a [user guide][userguide] and some
[examples][examples] Ivory programs. More information and tutorials are
available on [ivorylang.org](http://ivorylang.org).

The following paper describes the Ivory language:

* Trevor Elliott, Lee Pike, Simon Winwood, Pat Hickey, James Bielman, Jamey
  Sharp, Eric Seidel, John
  Launchbury. [Guilt-free Ivory](https://github.com/GaloisInc/ivory/blob/master/ivory-paper/ivory.pdf). Haskell
  Symposium, 2015.

Please cite this paper for when citing the language.

## Contents

* `ivory`: the Ivory language implementation and interpreter
* `ivory-backend-c`: a backend for compiling Ivory programs to C
* `ivory-examples`: sample Ivory programs
* `ivory-opts`: an optimization framework and some optimization
  implementations, for the Ivory AST.
* `ivory-bitdata`: a macro language library for specifying bit-precise
  Ivory operations.
* `ivory-hw`: a macro language library for writing hardware drivers
  in Ivory.
* `ivory-model-check`: a backend for verifying Ivory programs with CVC4

## Installing

Ivory is written in Haskell and uses several recent GHC extensions.  It is known
to work with with GHC 7.8.* and above.

We currently recommend using the [Stack][stack] build tool for Ivory language
packages and any programs which use them.
