\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Recent reports of car-hacking via software flaws~\cite{cars11} and insecure
low-level networking code~\cite{heartbleed} point toward the need for safe low-level programming
languages. Languages like C or C++ are still the gold standard in embedded
system development given the low-level control they provide in terms of memory
usage and timing behavior. Unfortunately, these languages provide
little support for creating high assurance software---they are
unsafe and unanalyzable.

In this paper we present the language \emph{Ivory}.\footnote{% Ivory is
  open-source (BSD3 license) and available at \url{ivory-lang.org}.}  Ivory
follows in the footsteps of other ``safe C'' programming languages, like
Cyclone~\cite{cyclone}, BitC~\cite{bitc}, and Rust~\cite{rust}---languages that
avoid many of the pitfalls of C, particularly related to memory safety and
undefined behavior, while being suitable for writing low-level code (e.g.,
device drivers), and having minimal runtime systems.

Ivory is particularly designed for safety-critical embedded programming. Such a
language should guarantee memory safety, prevent most undefined behaviors, and
provide integrated testing and verification tools. Typical C coding conventions
for safe embedded systems, such as those in use at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory~\cite{mars}, are enforced by Ivory's type system. The major
restrictions enforced by Ivory are restricted allocation for zero-overhead
garbage collection, enforcing loops to have constant upper bounds, avoiding
machine-dependent types (e.g., \cd{int}), and safe (i.e., guaranteed non-null)
dereferencing.

Ivory's implementation, however, is unique compared to previous safe C
languages: Ivory is implemented as an embedded domain-specific language (EDSL)
within Haskell.  In addition to the benefits of rapid language development, this
gives Ivory a powerful templating system---the language Haskell---allowing
low-level programs to be written in a high-level style, despite some of the
languages restrictions.

Ivory's type system is shallowly embedded within Haskell's type
system, taking advantage of the extensions provided
by GHC~\cite{dephaskell}.  Thus, well-typed Ivory programs are
guaranteed to produce memory safe executables, all without writing a
stand-alone type-checker.

In contrast, the Ivory syntax is \emph{deeply} embedded within
Haskell. This novel combination of shallowly-embedded types and
deeply-embedded syntax permits ease of development without sacrificing
the ability to develop various back-ends and verification tools: in
addition to the generation of embedded C for compilation, the Ivory
language suite includes an integrated SMT-based symbolic simulator and
a theorem-prover back-end.  All these back-ends share the same AST:
Ivory verifies what it compiles.


Ivory is not a toy language: we have used Ivory to write
\emph{SMACCMPilot}~\cite{smaccm}, a full-featured high-assurance
autopilot for a small unpiloted air vehicle.  Furthermore, Boeing has
used Ivory to implement a level-of-interoperability for
Stanag~4586~\cite{stanag}, a unpiloted air vehicle communications
standard. We know of a few additional small projects by other
developers in Ivory, as well.  There are well over 100~KLoC of Ivory in existence.

\paragraph{Contributions}
The main research contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of
Ivory: we show how to design a staged, type-safe, low-level language with a type
system which guarantees the absence of the sorts of run-time errors common in
low-level code, along with a powerful type-safe macro language. Previous safe-C
languages have relied on specialized type-checkers, whereas we show it can be
done (for the most part) within the type system of a general purpose functional
programming language, GHC's implementation of Haskell (henceforth ``GHC''). In
GHC, a powerful subset of dependent typing features are available without
sacrificing type-inference and decidable type-checking~\cite{dephaskell}; our
work demonstrates a practical application of these extensions for a real-world
language.

%% In 2014, Stephanie Weirich gave an ICFP keynote describing dependently-typed
%% programming using recent type and language extensions of GHC's implementation of
%% Haskell (henceforth ``GHC'') paper~\cite{weirich-keynote}. Weirich describes how
%% recent extensions to GHC provide much of the power of dependently-typed
%% programming, such as found in Agda~\cite{agda}, Idris~\cite{idris}, or
%% Coq~\cite{coq}. However, Ivory exemplifies the use of GHC dependent types in a
%% large, fully-featured EDSL. The language demonstrates that type checking for
%% safe systems programming can be embedded into GHC's type system, verifying
%% properties involving pointers, arrays, loops and local memory
%% allocation. Indeed, Ivory's type system goes beyond mere memory safety and
%% tracks control-flow effects at host-language compile-time.

After providing a brief introduction to the Ivory language in
Section~\ref{sec:ivory-overview}, we describe Ivory's embedding in GHC's type
system in Section~\ref{sec:ivory-embedding}. We highlight the aspects of the
language particularly relevant to memory-safety (e.g., pointers, structures, and
memory allocation). We also highlight shortcomings of the approach, describing
aspects of the language that cannot be checked by the host language's type
system (e.g., Ivory's module system).

Embedding a type system for a safe C language into GHC's type system is tricky
business. To gain confidence that our embedding is correct, we formalized a
model of Ivory in the Isabelle theorem prover~\cite{isabelle}, and used the model to
formally prove progress and preservation properties for Ivory. In the process,
we discovered minor bugs in Ivory's type embedding in GHC as well as
generalizations to Ivory that still preserve safety. We describe the
formalization, proofs, and extensions in Section~\ref{sec:semantics}.

Ivory goes beyond ensuring memory safety, the focus of most other safe C
programming languages, and also provides automated support for preventing errors
that result from other undefined behaviors in C (e.g., division by zero, left
bit-shifts by a negative value, etc.) as well as support for checking
user-provided assertions. Toward this end, Ivory supports writing user-supplied
assertions and pre- and post-conditions on functions, and includes a built-in
symbolic simulator targeting an SMT solver (CVC4~\cite{cvc4}), as well as an
theorem-prover back-end targeting ACL2~\cite{acl2}. For automated testing, a
QuickCheck-like property-based test-case generator is integrated into
Ivory. These tools are described in Section~\ref{sec:tools}. In
Section~\ref{sec:edsl}, we discuss some of the issues and our mitigations with
using a large EDSL for embedded programming projects.

We describe related work in safe C language and EDSLs in
Section~\ref{sec:related-work} and provide concluding remarks in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
