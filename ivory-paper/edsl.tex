\section{A Safe-C EDSL}
\label{sec:edsl}

In this section, we discuss the following issues we encountered when
implementing an EDSL targeted toward constructing realistic embedded
systems, notably integrating a C-like concrete syntax into the EDSL,
error-reporting, and uses of macro programming specifically tailored
to embedded system programming.

\paragraph{Concrete Syntax}

A benefit of the EDSL approach is that it relieves the language developer from
having to define and implement front-end syntax. However, that also generally
means that only users of the host language will be attracted to using the EDSL.
We want C/C++ developers to use Ivory!

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{code}
void mapProc(*uint8_t[4] arr, uint8_t x) {
  map ix {
    let v = arr@ix;
    *v = *v + x;
  }
}
\end{code}

its type. Could cite Dennis Ritchie's ``The Development of the C Language''
(\url{http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/chistory.ps}) to explain how C got the weird
array type semantics in the first place...}

We developed a concrete C-like syntax for Ivory as a quasi-quoter, which
facilitated use by Boeing as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}. In the
above we presented specific uses of quasi-quotation in Ivory to define a
concrete syntax for structs (Section~\ref{sec:area}) and bit-data
(Section~\ref{sec:bitdata}). In Figure~\ref{fig:concrete} we show an example
quasi-quoted Ivory procedure, equivalent to the that with the same name in
Section~\ref{sec:control}. The syntax is similar to a imperative languages like
C or Python, with some variations. For example, array types are not treated
specially like in C; the type (e.g., \cd{uint\_8[4]}) merely describe a memory
area, and a reference (\cd{*}) must be provided to use it. Instead of for-loops,
we have a \cd{map} operator that calculates the number of iterations from the
array being looped over. Let bindings are introduced. Finally, the \cd{@}
operator indexes into an array without dereferencing.

A quasi-quoted Ivory program is guaranteed to be type-safe, since the generated
Haskell program is type-checked, an important feature of the quasi-quoted
language is that it automatically generates the appropriate type signatures for
Ivory programs, relieving the programmer from doing so. The quasi-quoter also
generates Ivory modules automatically and guarantees that procedure names match
their Haskell identifiers, obviating the problems discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:modules}. The quasi-quoter supports anti-quotation, so that
Haskell can still be used as a macro language. All of Boeing's development in
Ivory is via the quasi-quoter.

Implementing a quasi-quoter means that we have defined a lexer and parser for
the concrete syntax. Because Ivory is deeply embedded in Haskell, there is a
concrete data type (i.e., the abstract syntax tree (AST)) over which
optimizations and back-ends are implemented. The distance from Ivory as an EDSL
and a stand-alone compiler is surprisingly small, essentially requiring a
type-checker and a front-end targeting the AST directly. In this manner, we are
able to ``grow'' a compiler, from an EDSL to a stand-alone system.


\paragraph{Haskell as Macro Language}

C programmers are accustomed to using the C Pre-Processor (CPP) as a
limited macro and metaprogramming system.  Embedding Ivory within
Haskell allows users the full power of Haskell as a type-safe
metaprogramming environment for Ivory. We have used this feature in a
variety of ways, specifically beneficial to embedded development.

% CPP is significantly limited: it was
% originally designed to prohibit recursion during macro expansion (although
% C99's variadic macros have been abused to implement near-arbitrary
% recursion~\cite{cpp-turing}). 

% Widely used tools such as lex~\cite{lex} and
% yacc~\cite{yacc} demonstrate other approaches to metaprogramming in C, and some
% projects such as libxcb~\cite{xcb} have produced specialized metaprogramming
% tools in languages such as m4~\cite{m4}.

\begin{itemize}
%% \item Our Tower component architecture allows compositional specification of
%%   components and their message-passing channels. When instantiating a particular
%%   configuration of a collection of components, the Tower backend performs
%%   whole-program analysis of the data-flow graph to statically allocate exactly
%%   as much buffer space as necessary, avoiding dynamic memory allocation.
\item In embedded systems, a peripheral device's clock may be derived from a
  platform-wide clock by a programmable clock divider. However, the platform
  clock may be configurable. Configuring, say, a serial port to operate at
  115200bps, may require a complex search over the space of clock divider and
  other configuration settings based on the current platform clock. These
  settings will be the same on every run for a given application, so we can
  precompute them in Haskell.
\item We frequently use Haskell type-classes to provide function overloading for
  Ivory. For example, the ivory-serialize library provides a ``Packable''
  typeclass capturing the code needed to serialize or deserialize user-specified
  types. This style of overloading is resolved during Haskell run-time, so the
  generated C is monomorphized.
\item Mathematical metaprogramming has been a particularly powerful tool when combined
with Ivory. Edward Kmett's automatic differentiation~\cite{ad} and linear
algebra~\cite{linear} packages, which depend primarily on the Haskell Prelude's
numeric typeclasses, operate transparently over Ivory expressions---despite
having been designed independently. This allowed us to build a stand-alone
package, ``estimator''~\cite{estimator}, which automatically derives an Extended
Kalman Filter from a concise model written in pure Haskell. Like linear and ad,
the estimator package is independent of Ivory, but when evaluated over an Ivory
floating-point type, the result is a C implementation of the derived Kalman
filter.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Error Reporting}
%% Ivory's The use of advanced type-system features can produce elaborate and
%% confusing type-error messages to the user. Idris~\cite{christiansen2014reflect}
%% allows the programmer to supply error handlers, which are given a data structure
%% representing the compiler's error message and can rewrite it to insert
%% domain-specific knowledge. Unfortunately, GHC Haskell does not currently support
%% such a feature.

%% Thus, the EDSL author can provide custom type-error
%% messages using language the application programmers will understand.

Dynamically reporting errors in an EDSL is made difficult by the lack of
source locations. Consider the Ivory expression \hbox{\cd{x / y},} which induces a
runtime assertion \cd{y != 0}, inserted into the generated back-end (e.g., C code). If the assertion fails, we would like to include
a \emph{Haskell} source location in the error message to direct the programmer to the source of
the error. The question is then: how are we to obtain the source location in the first place?
Ivory programs are comprised of Haskell expressions and Haskell is
pure--functions cannot depend on their call-site--so we must look outside the
language proper to obtain source locations.

We opted to write a compiler plugin that rewrites GHC's intermediate
representation to add the source locations. To do so, we extended the \cd{Ivory} statement type with a new
\cd{Location} constructor that contains a location in the Haskell source,
essentially a special type of comment. The plugin then extracts the source
locations from GHC and wraps all actions in the \cd{Ivory} monad with a
\cd{withLocation} function that emits a \cd{Location} statement before executing
the wrapped action.

The approach limits the location granularity to
lines rather than columns, but it requires only modest changes to the
Ivory compiler and--importantly--no changes to Ivory code. As the plugin
itself requires little knowledge of Ivory, we have abstracted it out into a
separate package~\cite{ghc-srcspan-plugin} that can be reused by other projects.
Furthermore, we have since submitted a lightweight extension to GHC that allows
functions to request their call-site by taking a special implicit
parameter~\cite{lewis2000implicit} as an argument, which should become available
in the 7.12 release.
